\* Configuration specifically for detecting anomalies allowed in Snapshot Isolation
\* This config is designed to FIND write skew and other anomalies that SI permits
SPECIFICATION Spec
INVARIANTS 
    \* Core invariants that should NEVER be violated
    TypeInvariant
    ConsistencyInvariant
    SnapshotAtomicity
    SnapshotNoPartialStates
    SnapshotNoDirtyReads
    FirstCommitterWins
    SnapshotNoLostUpdates
    \* Note: We do NOT include write skew prevention here
    \* because we want to detect when it occurs
PROPERTIES
    \* Temporal properties
    EventuallyComplete
    SnapshotProgress
    \* Anomaly detection properties (these may be violated in SI)
    SnapshotWriteSkewDetection  \* This should be SATISFIABLE (can occur)
CONSTANTS
    KEYS = {k1, k2, k3}  \* More keys to enable complex scenarios
    TRANSACTIONS = {t1, t2, t3}  \* More transactions for complex interleavings
    VALUES = {v1, v2}
    NULL = null
CHECK_DEADLOCK FALSE
\* Use smaller state space for anomaly detection
